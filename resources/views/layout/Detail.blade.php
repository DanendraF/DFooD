            <h1 class="judul">FISH AND CHIPS</h1>
            <p class="desc">
                Fish and chips is a classic British dish made by battering and frying fish, served with crispy chips (fries) 
                and often accompanied by mushy peas. The combination of crispy exterior and tender interior, along with the salty 
                flavor of the chips, makes for a comforting and satisfying meal. Traditionally enjoyed with a side of tartar sauce 
                or malt vinegar, this dish offers a delightful contrast between the hot, crispy batter and the soft, flaky fish inside.
                The dishâ€™s simple yet flavorful profile has made it a beloved staple in British cuisine, perfect for a hearty lunch or dinner. 
                Whether enjoyed at a local pub or made at home, fish and chips continues to be a favorite choice for those seeking a taste of classic comfort food.
